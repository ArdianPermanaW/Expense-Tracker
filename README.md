done i think. But i wanna add stuff like specify which year cuz its kinda weird rn where the sum is gonna add everything at the month of each year

use before every command: py app.py 

command list:
- add --description (your desc here) --amount (amount goes here)
- list
- summary --month (what month (its optional))
- delete --id (id that u want to delete) (tbh if you want to delete just go to the csv file and delete what you want its much easier than using this)
